## Features üîê

-   **End-to-End Encryption** - Using Elliptical Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) encryption, your messages are secure from the moment they're sent to the moment they're received.
-   **Database-less** - With no central database, your conversations aren't stored. Once they're gone, they're gone for good.
-   **Anonymous** - No sign-ups, no log-ins, no personal information. Just start chatting.
-   **Beautiful UI** - Thanks to TailwindCSS, Paranoia provides an intuitive, clean, and visually appealing user experience.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

At its core, Paranoia uses the power of Next.js, tailwindcss, and Socket.io to deliver an unparalleled chatting experience.

1. **Next.js** - A versatile framework that helps us manage the server-side rendering and generate static websites for each new chat room.
2. **TailwindCSS** - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes such as `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
3. **Socket.io** - Enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of:
    - A Node.js (in my case Express.js) [server](https://github.com/ShinnoT/terminal-chat-backend)
    - A JavaScript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js)

All messages are encrypted and decrypted using the Elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman (ECDH) key agreement protocol. This ensures that even if someone is able to intercept the messages, they won't be able to decipher them without the key.

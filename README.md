# Terminal Chat App

Get an old school feel of what it used to be like to chat in the earliest days of the internet.

## TODO

-   change some messages to logging messages (color yellow?)
-   remove secretKey when user disconnects (encryption lost)
-   regenerate another key when another user reconnects
-   max in room 2?? (probably yes because ECDH is only for 2 clients)
-   change name from "room" to something cooler like "secret space"

-   think about changing password to "proof of life" questions - a question only you 2 would know the answer to as the password
